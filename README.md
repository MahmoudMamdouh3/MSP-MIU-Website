# MSP Tech Club - Website & Automation Systems

## Introduction

This repository is part of the work we're doing at the **MSP Tech Club at Misr International University** to build useful systems that actually serve the needs of the club. The goal is simple: solve real problems we face ‚Äî faster communication, better organization, less manual work ‚Äî using clean, maintainable code.

Everything here is built with **Django**, so the backend and frontend are unified under one stack. That makes it easier for contributors to get involved, whether you're writing APIs, building UI, or automating tasks.

If you're contributing to this repo, you're not just writing code ‚Äî you're helping the club run more efficiently, and building tools that will be used by real people across events, sessions, recruitment, and more.

This project is also meant to be a learning experience. Whether you're familiar with Python or just getting started, the systems are designed to be easy to follow, practical, and extendable.

At this point, the project is intentionally **monolithic** ‚Äî everything lives in one codebase. This simplifies development and makes it easier for contributors to understand the full system without jumping across multiple services or repositories.

## Core Systems to Be Built

This repository will eventually include several internal tools, all integrated into the same Django-based system:

- **Email Automation**  
  Send customized emails to members and applicants using templates and CSV input.

- **WhatsApp Group Automation**  
  Add users to WhatsApp groups automatically based on Excel/CSV data using automation tools.

- **Discord Automation**  
  Handle roles, messages, and channels in our Discord server via bot integrations.

- **Attendance System**  
  A system to take and verify attendance at events, designed to scale beyond 200+ attendees.

- **Certificate Generator**  
  Automatically generate digital certificates from member lists or event participation data.

- **Smart Media Tools**  
  Tools for generating name tags or content from text (e.g., prompts for social media designs).

- **Sessions & Events Scheduler**  
  A centralized place to plan and view upcoming technical and non-technical sessions.

- **Backend System (Django)**  
  REST APIs, admin logic, and automation scripts powering all features. Clean, secure, and built for maintainability.

- **Frontend (Django Templates + Tailwind CSS)**  
  Web interface for all users (public, members, board), integrated directly into the Django backend for faster iteration.

- **Database Layer**  
  Structured models using Django ORM, with support for migrations, data seeding, and flexible integrations.

- **Club Website Platform**  
  The central platform that ties all tools together ‚Äî public site, member portal, event system, and internal dashboards ‚Äî all under one unified system.

# üõë Do These Before You Start Coding!

## ‚úÖ 1. Install VS Code
Get it from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## ‚úÖ 2. Install Python & Jupyter Extensions in VS Code
- Open VS Code
- Go to the Extensions tab (Ctrl + Shift + X)
- Search and install:
  - ‚úÖ Python
  - ‚úÖ Jupyter

## ‚úÖ 3. Make Sure Python is Installed
Download it: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Check installation by running (in terminal):
```bash
python --version
python3 --version
```

## ‚úÖ 4. Make Sure Git is Installed
```bash
git --version
```
Avoid pushing unnecessary files or folders to important branches. If you need help with Git, Mohamed Hisham is the go-to guy, feel free to ask him.

## ‚úÖ 5. Use Git Properly
- Create a separate branch for whatever feature you're working on, merge later when needed.
- Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
- Join our club's public repo as a contributor:
  - Send your email to Shady or Mahmoud, they'll add you.
  - Repo: https://github.com/MahmoudMamdouh3/MSP-MIU-Website

Configure Git on your machine:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
git config --global core.autocrlf
```

## üß™ Virtual Environment Setup (Important!)
Before installing any Python dependencies, always create a virtual environment, this avoids version conflicts and keeps things clean.

**Create command:**
```bash
python3 -m venv your_env_name
```

**üîÑ Activate the environment:**
- Linux/macOS: `source your_env_name/bin/activate`
- Windows: `your_env_name\Scripts\activate`

**üì¶ Install packages (inside the env):**
```bash
pip install package_name
```

**‚ùå Deactivate when done:**
```bash
deactivate
```

## üìì Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code
We'll be using Jupyter notebooks for most demos or work.

If not already installed:
```bash
pip install notebook
```

- Jupyter notebook files have the .ipynb extension. You can create any file and rename it to that.
- Make sure the top-right corner of the notebook shows the correct Python interpreter (kernel).
- If it's wrong, click it and select your virtual environment.
